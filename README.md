# ROS_RPi
Setup consists of a RaspberryPi with a MotorHAT to control atleast 2 motors for an autonomous robot. This repository contains nodes that enable communication with the MotorHAT, and thereby control of these motors, via ROS.

## MotorHAT Driver
The following repository was found to work with our setup. This will serve as the foundation for sending commands to the motors.
